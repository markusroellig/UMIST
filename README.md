 Create isotopic chemistry from UMIST database
 
Most astrochemical databases8such as the Umist Database for Astrochemistry (UDfA) or the [Kinetic Database for Astrochemistry (KIDA)](http://kida.obs.u-bordeaux1.fr/) od not contain isotopic information. Only chemical reactions for the main isotopologues are listed. I wrote a Mathematica ® package that takes a chemical reaction and composes all possible isotopic variants of that reaction. Then a heuristic set of rules is applied to filter out those permutations that are chemically likely. Details are described in [Röllig & Ossenkopf (2013)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...550A..56R).
